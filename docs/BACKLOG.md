# Coffices Backlog

## High Priority

### Social Media Sharing Enhancement
**Status**: Backlogged  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: Medium-High  

**Problem**: Social media crawlers (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) don't execute JavaScript, so they show generic app information instead of venue-specific details when sharing coffice deeplinks.

**Current State**: 
- ✅ Browser sharing works perfectly
- ✅ Search engine indexing works
- ✅ User experience is good
- ❌ Social media previews show generic app info

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. **Next.js Migration** (Recommended)
   - Convert to Next.js for automatic server-side rendering
   - Provides best long-term solution
   - Requires significant refactoring

2. **Pre-rendering Service**
   - Use Prerender.io or BromBone
   - Quick implementation
   - Ongoing service cost

3. **Static Site Generation**
   - Generate static HTML for each coffice at build time
   - Good performance
   - Requires build-time data fetching

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Facebook sharing shows venue-specific title, description, and image
- [ ] Twitter cards display venue information
- [ ] LinkedIn sharing shows correct preview
- [ ] WhatsApp sharing shows venue details
- [ ] All existing functionality remains intact
