# Non-Critical Updates & UX Improvements

This document tracks non-urgent improvements and feature ideas for future development rounds.

## SearchBar: Use Map Center for Venue Search
- **Current:** Venue search is biased to user's current location.
- **Proposed:** Use the current map center for the location and radius in the Google Places Autocomplete API.
- **Why:** Supports travel planning and searching for venues in other cities/regions, not just "near me".
- **Status:** Tabled for future update. Needs careful handling to avoid breaking other features.

## User Location Pulsing Marker
- **Goal:** Ensure the user's location pulsing marker updates its position at least every 30 seconds.
- **Why:** Keeps the user's location accurate on the map during longer sessions or movement.
- **Status:** Tabled for future update.

---

## Marker Rendering Optimization
- **Goal:** Enhance marker rendering logic so that markers already visible on the map are not re-rendered unnecessarily while navigating or panning the map.
- **Why:** Improves map performance and user experience, especially with many markers.
- **Status:** Tabled for future update.
